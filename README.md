# Advanced React Workshop Labs

In this example we want to build a weather app.

1. Create a GraphQL endpoint that wraps a weather REST API. You can use https://darksky.net/dev/ for example. Take a fixed location e.g. Paris.
2. Create a list of locations (cities). They should include latitude, longitude and the city name. Expose this data via GraphQL. In the front-end people should be able to switch between locations.
3. Allow to create users. A user can have a favourite list of locations. Once the user is authenticated they automatically fetch the weather data for all their favourite locations.
