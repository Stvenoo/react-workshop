# Advanced React Workshop Labs

Welcome, we're happy to have you here with us in Paris! üá´üá∑üç∑ü•ñ

Before the workshop starts please make sure you can get this repository and run it locally:

```
git clone git@github.com:reacteurope/react-workshop.git
cd react-workshop
npm install
npm start
```

A browser window should open at `localhost:3000` (if not, try going to that URL manually) and you should see a welcome message. If so, you're set up and ready to go!

Make sure you have [`git`](https://git-scm.com/) and the latest stable version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. If any of these commands fail, please reinstall the relevant binary.

Each lab is part of a branch which Max & Nik will announce after each presentation during the workshop.
